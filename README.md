**Concept**
Ive used all three services but i was always looking for a one in all solution. By taking the importanc of imersing by Pimsleur and reading by Lingq /n
and we add that to the space reption activites freecodecamp.org gives. I think that would make learning a language feel like your in school.
It would be easy to do 30 minutes of studying while getting all three learning activites. See, hear, read and practicing.
