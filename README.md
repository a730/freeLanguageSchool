**Why make this**

The concept came to me while I was learning how to code. In coding, the learning is always hands-on—you build, test, and iterate immediately. That sparked a question: Why isn’t there a platform that delivers the same interactive, practical experience for language learning?

Drawing from language acquisition theory, babies learn through “comprehensible input”—new information that’s understandable because it connects to what you already know. It’s like catching the punchline of a joke without the full setup; you need that foundation to bridge the gap. My vision is an open-source, completely free platform that’s community-driven and open to contributions, making high-quality language education accessible to everyone.

**The Goal?**
To recreate the energy of a real classroom with rich, hands-on materials that make learning feel engaging and natural. Picture this: Start with a concise grammar lecture, then dive into interactive assignments to apply it right away. Follow up with an audio challenge to sharpen listening skills, and cap it off with a creative workshop—like writing about your favorite hobby using the new rules.

**Concept**
Ive used all three services but i was always looking for a one in all solution. By taking the importanc of imersing by Pimsleur and reading by Lingq /n
and we add that to the space reption activites freecodecamp.org gives. I think that would make learning a language feel like your in school.
It would be easy to do 30 minutes of studying while getting all three learning activites. See, hear, read while practicing.
